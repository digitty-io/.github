## 🦄 DIGITTY, 
The start of something great, new, open & closed source, AI, highly automated, about Project Management, Product Management, Requirements-engineering, software development, mangement, devOps, designOps, short-cuts, forecasts, risk, complexity, collaborative, and actually SaaS-driven, backed up by open minds, and a heart of for Open Source & fair code.

So, to enable some of our very technical and ai-driven core features, we will take the first steps to create an open standard for "time-boxed strategies & tactics to solve various problems, and meet requirements". 


Something great is in the making 🚀
